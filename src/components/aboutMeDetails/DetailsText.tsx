				My adventure with programming began more than two years ago. I started by learning Html, Css and Javascript
				decently, to then enter the world of React and one of its more popular frameworks NextJs. I am currently
				developing my knowledge in this area. In addition, I am planning to learn backend technologies as well - NodeJs,
				Express, maybe Java. At the moment I am an aspiring Junior Frontend Developer, that wants to get his first job,
				and to one day be called Fullstack Developer.

				I am disciplined, ambitious, and ready to continuously develop programming skills. I am interested in long-term
				collaboration and work that allows me to improve and contribute significantly to the company. I am able to work
				under pressure, both as a part of the team and independently when necessary. I enjoy problem-solving and
				leveraging my creativity in work.
