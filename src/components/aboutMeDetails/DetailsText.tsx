				My programming journey began nearly 3 years ago with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, quickly leading me to master
				React and Next.js, the backbone of my frontend skills. Over time, I’ve explored backend development with
				Node.js, Express, MongoDB with Mongoose, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, including work with REST APIs and databases like
				SQL and Firebase. While I’m strongest in frontend, I’m steadily growing my backend experience too.

				I’m a Frontend Developer with my sights set on full-stack growth. I’m driven, hardworking, and excited to build
				real-world experience. I’d love to join a team where I can tackle cool projects, sharpen my skills, and evolve
				as a developer. I’m comfortable working solo or collaborating, and I enjoy digging into problems and coming up
				with smart solutions.
