				My programming journey started over two years ago with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I quickly moved on to React
				and Next.js, which became the core of my frontend skills. Over time, I began exploring backend development with
				Node.js, Express.js, and Mongoose, working with databases like MongoDB and Firebase, as well as integrating REST
				APIs. I’m continuously learning and expanding my skills in both areas.

				I’m an aspiring Junior Frontend Developer, aiming to become a Fullstack Developer. I’m motivated, hardworking,
				and eager to gain hands-on experience. I’m looking for a long-term opportunity where I can contribute to
				interesting projects, improve my skills, and grow as a developer. I work well both independently and as part of
				a team, and I enjoy solving problems and finding creative solutions.
