				My programming journey began over two years ago. I started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then ventured into
				React and its popular framework Next.js. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in this area. Additionally, I
				plan to learn backend technologies such as Node.js, Express, and possibly Java. At the moment I am an aspiring
				Junior Frontend Developer eager to get my first job and ultimately become a Fullstack Developer someday.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am disciplined, ambitious, and ready to continuously improve my programming skills. I am interested in a
				long-term collaboration and job that allows me to contribute significantly to the company while enhancing my
				abilities. I can work under pressure, both as a part of the team and independently when necessary.
				Problem-solving and leveraging creativity are aspects of work that I particularly enjoy.
