The app is cloning the Netflix site - I used the TMDB database, which is not as detailed as the Netflix one, this means no videos, no detailed information about individual episodes of series or other detailed data. The application contains many sub-pages, starting from the main view, through the whole process of logging in and registering, selecting a profile and editing it (not all properties can be edited), up to the main page of series, movies and individual sub-pages. Due to the nature of the app I used different icons, used some dummy texts and this is not a pixel perfect clone - mainly due to a different api, which dictates a different placement of for example series and movie posters.',
