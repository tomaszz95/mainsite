<h1>Portfolio page</h1>

<p>Welcome! This is my portfolio page, built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The site is fully responsive across all devices and follows top SEO practices. Itâ€™s a straightforward app featuring sub-pages like About Me, Contact, and Projects, plus dynamic pages for individual projects Iâ€™ve created. You can explore details about me, my contact info, the technologies I use, and even download my resume directly from the site. The Projects section showcases my work with links to GitHub repositories, live demos, and deeper insights into each one. Plus, Iâ€™ve written over 100 unit tests of varying complexity using Jest and RTL to ensure most components work flawlessly.</p>
